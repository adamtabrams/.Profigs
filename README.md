# .profigs
These are my current system configurations and .RCs


### To Use
First, clone or download this DIRECTLY to your home directory (these files are intended only for unix systems)

To ensure the directory is in the correct location and to see which
files/directories it contains, run: ls $HOME/.profigs/

Then, be sure to backup any conflicting files by moving them to a
backup directory.

Finally, you can run $HOME/.profigs/.scripts/linkprofigs to create
symlinks to each of the config files/directories.

### Todo
Add important files from /etc and others
Add list of required/recommended programs
Polish config files and clean up repo
Add more documentation
