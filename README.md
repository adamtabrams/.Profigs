## To Use
These configurations are intended for MacOS.

First, clone or download this DIRECTLY to your $HOME directory

To ensure the directory is in the correct location and to see which
files and directories it contains, run: ls $HOME/.Profigs

Now you can run $HOME/.Profigs/linkprofigs to create
symlinks to each of the config files and directories.

Note: Nothing is overwritten by the script. Old configuration
files will be stored in $HOME/.cache/profigs/{data-time}.
