# .profigs
These are my current system configurations and .RCs


### To Use
First, clone or download this DIRECTLY to your $HOME directory (these files are intended only for unix systems)

To ensure the directory is in the correct location and to see which
files and directories it contains, run: ls $HOME/.profigs/

Now you can run $HOME/.profigs/linkprofigs to create
symlinks to each of the config files and directories.

Note: The script will print a lot of output, that verbosity is
intended. Nothing is overwritten by the script. Old
configuration files will be stored in
$HOME/.old-configs/{data-time}.
